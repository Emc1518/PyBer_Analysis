Most of Pyber's revenue is generated in urban cities because there are more rideshare drivers and ridesharing is used more often in Urban cities. Drivers in rural cities are making more per ride than drivers in urban cities even though the number of rides in rural cities is lower than in urban cities. The rideshare data of suburban cities shows that drivers numbers are in between rural and urban cities. All three city types show similar increases and decreases in fares from January to April 2019. 


## **Summary**

The following recommendations are made based on the above results:

1. Drivers in rural cities are out-earning drivers in urban cities even though the number of rides is much less in rural cities than in urban cities. This may be because riders are travelling further in rural cities than urban cities. It may be a good idea to increase the fare that urban drivers can charge to capitalize on the frequency that rideshare services are used in urban cities.

2. Create incentives for new drivers to join Pyber in rural areas because drivers in rural cities are driving longer distances that take more time to complete, making them unavailble to take other rides.

3. Provide bonuses to urban drivers who are generating the most profit for Pyber to avoid turn-over and also provide incentives for riders to increase/maintain use of services.
